\section*{Work done}

This is an overview of the work performed in the past week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Second chapter finished that provides an in-depth explanation about virtualization.
\item Third chapter started about security issues in virtual networks.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Planning}
 
This week, I would like to finish chapter 3.

\section*{Problems}

No problems encountered.

\section*{Issues}

No issues encountered.

\section*{Assistance}

By the end of this week, (when my theoretical study is finished), I most likely will sent the Professor an e-mail to make an appointment to review my work so far and to discuss the practical testing that needs to be performed. \\
However, due to project work for other courses, this email could be delayed, but I will try my best to finish chapter 3 this week.
