\section{Work done}

This is an overview of the accomplished work:
\begin{itemize}
\item Monday November 24: I returned to the Ems Lab to continue the installation of Windows Server 2012 on the `pizza server' and this time,  the installation completed successfully. However, since I did not have a wired network connection, I was unable to install Hyper-V.
\item I contacted Ms. Fei Guan to install the server and the router in the datacenter next week.
\end{itemize}

Together with Ms. Fei Guan, I will install the router and server in the datacenter this Tuesday (December 2).
