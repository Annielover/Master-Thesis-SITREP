\section{Work done}

This is an overview of the accomplished work so far in the first semester:
\begin{itemize}
\item Microsoft Windows Server 2012 is freshly installed on the pizzaserver.
\item The 1U pizza server is installed in a slot of a rack in the datacenter with help of Ms. Fei Guan and Mr. Long Peng. They have also assigned some IP addresses.
\item The NetGear router's firmware is updated to it's latest version and installed in the datacenter.
\end{itemize}
